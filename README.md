# 🛒 Market Basket Analysis using Apriori Algorithm

A Market Basket Analysis project using the Apriori algorithm in Python to uncover product associations and purchasing patterns from retail transaction data.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

Market Basket Analysis is a popular data mining technique used to analyze purchasing habits by identifying relationships between items frequently bought together. This project utilizes the **Apriori algorithm** to perform association rule learning on transaction data, helping businesses optimize cross-selling strategies and product placements.

Whenever you visit a retail supermarket, you may notice that items such as bread & butter, beer & chips, or baby diapers & wipes are placed together. Market Basket Analysis helps detect these associations based on historical transaction data.
